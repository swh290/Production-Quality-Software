-Does not follow the Java code convention:
Should be:
public AddressBook(String userID, String addressBookName){
		this.userID = userID;
		this.addressBookName = addressBookName;
	}
but was:
public AddressBook(String userID, String addressBookName)
	{
		this.userID = userID;
		this.addressBookName = addressBookName;
	}
	
Should be:
file = new File(userID+addressBookName +".adb");
but was:
file=new File(userID+addressBookName +".adb");

-indentation inconsistent: sometimes two spaces but sometimes four
	
AddressBook.java:

-Unnecessary flag in method removeEntry (line 86) or remove return in the for loop
-Using String "delimiter" as delimiter when write to file, could fail if "delimiter" is also data stores in contact
-Forget to modify JavaDoc at line 206
-Code duplication between line 226 and line 312

Contact.java:

-Bad design of contactId. Need to remember this Id when remove an entry form an address book

EmailAddress.java and PhoneNumber.java:

-Feel comfortable when typing email as name@domain.com but not typing name and domain separately.
-Same as PhoneNumber

PostalAddress.java:
-What if an user is not in the U.S. and doesn't have state element in his/her address?
